-  Hi, I’m Brian Lee
-  I’m interested in sports, and fast pace activites but I also enjoy my fair share of video games!
-  I’m currently learning JavaScript and React, also attending SFU for Data science as machine learning feel extremly important
-  My strong suits, I am able to make algorithms at decent enough time complexity, I feel as though I have a solid comprehension of data structures
